I've included the Matlab file that does the image processing part of the robot 
The Matlab code will use the mounted camera of the robot to find spherical objects i.e. the ball of a specific color
and pass on the information to the a microcontroller[Arduino duemilanove]

I've also included the Arduino code [.pde file] that picks up the control signals from generated by Matlab via serial interfacing and process it accordingly using PID control algorithm to move the wheel of the robot

I guess implementing the same with OpenCV would generate better result but at the moment it’s in Matlab
